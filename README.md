## What is Vuex?
- State management and pattern library
- Used most commonly with the Vue.js framework
- Very similar to Redux and Flux
- Centralised store for all components

## Why use Vuex?
- Components need to share state in many cases
- Vuex provides a single source of truth for data/state
- No need to pass props down through components
